# sc_fs_demo

A working demo of **Spark Declarative Pipelines (SDP) + the Declarative Batch Feature Store**, orchestrated by a Lakeflow Job and declared via Databricks Asset Bundles. Fully serverless.

The pipeline turns raw event tables into governed, point-in-time-joinable feature tables (materialized views), then assembles training and prediction datasets from them with `create_training_set` — no feature registration step, no hand-written joins.

## Start here

1. **Run it** — see [Deploy + run](#deploy--run). One command seeds data; one runs the whole DAG.
2. **`src/pipeline/`** — the feature logic. Each `.sql` file is one materialized view (one feature table). Read `common/silver_account.sql` first (simplest), then `scroll/silver_session.sql` (windowed aggregation + JSON parsing).
3. **`src/features/feature_catalog.py`** — how features are discovered from the MVs (no registration).
4. **`src/jobs/build_training_set.py`** — how a model's feature subset becomes a training set via `create_training_set` (the replacement for a wide `auto_join` table).
5. **`resources/`** — how it's wired: `pipeline.yml` (the SDP pipeline) and `job.yml` (the orchestrating DAG).

## Runnable entry points

Run with `databricks bundle run <name>` (see [Deploy + run](#deploy--run) for setup):

| Name | What it does |
|---|---|
| `sc_fs_demo_seed_initial_data` | Seeds synthetic game data into `<catalog>.<schema>.src_*`. Run once first. |
| `sc_fs_demo_orchestrator` | The main DAG: refreshes the SDP pipeline, then builds the training and prediction sets. |
| `sc_fs_demo_pipeline` | The SDP pipeline alone (all feature MVs + labels). |
| `sc_fs_demo_append_one_day` | Appends one new day of events — then re-run the pipeline to watch it refresh **incrementally**. |
| `sc_fs_demo_restate_three_dates` | Rewrites 3 historical dates — re-run the pipeline to see only the affected slice recompute. |

## How features work

- **Each MV is a feature table.** Every feature MV declares `PRIMARY KEY (account_id, observation_date TIMESERIES)`. That TIMESERIES key is what makes it a governed, discoverable, point-in-time-joinable feature table in Unity Catalog — so there is no separate `create_feature`/registration step.
- **The catalog is derived from the MVs.** `feature_catalog.py` lists the feature-table MVs; every non-PK column becomes a `Feature`. Adding a column to an MV adds a feature with no mapping to maintain.
- **A model is a list of feature names.** `build_training_set.py` / `build_prediction_set.py` select a subset (`SCROLL_CHURN_FEATURES`) and pass the `Feature` objects to `create_training_set`, which performs the point-in-time join. A different model is just a different list — same MVs, same pipeline.

## Seeing incremental refresh (Enzyme)

The materialized views refresh **incrementally** on serverless: when new data arrives, only the changed slice is recomputed, not the whole table. To observe it:

1. Run `sc_fs_demo_append_one_day` (or `sc_fs_demo_restate_three_dates`).
2. Re-run `sc_fs_demo_pipeline`.
3. In the pipeline UI, the **Tables** tab shows each MV's refresh type (`Incremental` / `No change` / `Full recompute`). MVs whose inputs didn't change are skipped; only the affected ones recompute.

`scroll/silver_session_recent.sql` shows a windowed feature table — the trailing 30 days ending at a deterministic run-date parameter (`partition_date`, set at deploy) rather than `current_date()` — so new days append incrementally. The window moves by providing a new `partition_date`.

## Source tables (`src_*`)

Six append-only event streams keyed on `account_id` + an event timestamp (with a date-grain `event_date` cluster key), one account dimension, and one daily snapshot.

| Table | Grain | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `src_dim_account` | one row per `account_id` | Account dimension: `created_at`, `country`, `install_source`, `spender_class` (whale / dolphin / minnow / non_spender), `temporal_pattern`. |
| `src_events_login` | one row per login | Login events (~1.2/account/day). Activity, recency, and the next-7d-login label. |
| `src_events_battle` | one row per battle | Battle outcomes (~2/account/day): `won` flag, `duration_seconds`. |
| `src_events_purchase` | one row per purchase | In-app purchases: `category` (gems / cards / chest / pass / cosmetic), `amount_usd`. |
| `src_events_progression` | one row per level-up | Level-ups (~0.35/account/day) with cumulative `new_level`. |
| `src_events_social` | one row per social event | Social interactions (~1/account/day): `event_type` (message / invite / gift). |
| `src_events_session` | one row per session | Play sessions (~1.1/account/day) with a raw `payload_json` (`{duration_s, device, level_reached}`) parsed via `from_json`. |
| `src_clan_membership_daily` | one row per (`account_id`, `date`) | Daily slowly-changing snapshot of clan membership: `is_clan_member` boolean. |

## SQL patterns, and where to find each

| Pattern | File |
|---|---|
| Multi-stage CTEs | `pipeline/scroll/silver_battle.sql` |
| Conditional-aggregation pivot (code-generated, DataFrame API) | `pipeline/scroll/silver_purchase.py` |
| Forward range-window label | `pipeline/common/labels_did_login_within_7d.sql` |
| JSON struct parsing | `pipeline/scroll/silver_session.sql` (`from_json`) |
| Snapshot / dim joins | `pipeline/common/silver_account.sql`, `pipeline/scroll/silver_social_enriched.sql` |
| Windowed feature table with a parameterized cutoff (incremental append) | `pipeline/scroll/silver_session_recent.sql` |
| Feature subset selection (per-model) | `jobs/build_training_set.py`, `build_prediction_set.py` |
| Data-quality expectations | most feature MVs (`CONSTRAINT ... EXPECT (...)`) |

## Deploy + run

Set your CLI profile in `databricks.yml` (`targets.dev.workspace.profile`) and your `catalog`/`schema` via the bundle variables. `partition_date` (the run date) is **required** and has no default — pass it on every command:

```bash
databricks bundle validate --var partition_date=$(date +%F)
databricks bundle deploy   --var partition_date=$(date +%F)
databricks bundle run sc_fs_demo_seed_initial_data --var partition_date=$(date +%F)   # once, to seed data
databricks bundle run sc_fs_demo_orchestrator      --var partition_date=$(date +%F)   # the full DAG
```

Override catalog/schema the same way: `--var catalog=my_catalog --var schema=my_schema`.

## Outputs to inspect after a run

- `<catalog>.<schema>.src_*` — 8 source tables
- `silver_*` — feature-table MVs (pure intermediates like the date spine, spender tier, and purchase velocity are pipeline-private and not published to the catalog)
- `labels_did_login_within_7d` — label MV (also the training eligibility set)
- `eligibility_prediction` — prediction eligibility set (active accounts at the latest observation_date)
- `scroll_raw_training` — training dataset (eligibility set + PIT-joined features + label)
- `scroll_raw_prediction` — prediction dataset (eligibility set + PIT-joined features, no label)
